History
Hello Styles
Objective
The purpose of this lab is to understand how CSS styles apply to structured HTML elements within a web page.

Learning
In this lab, we will expand upon our previous lab Hello HTML by styling it with an external CSS sheet. We will also be practicing referencing a wireframe for creating our design. This lab is based off a real world scenario you might encounter in your role as a software developer; you may not be the one designing the websites, but you will be the one bringing them to life.

If you did not previously complete Hello Html, you can find a basic completion here to work with.

Topics:

Utilizing a given wire frame.
Styling with CSS.
Achieving
In this lab, we will utilize a given wire frame to style our website with CSS according to its guidelines.

Note: While you Google around, you may come across the flexbox and grid CSS layout models. Do not use these for this lab! Margin and padding and other display properties will be a good place to start for this challenge.

Your work will result in:

A website that closely matches the given wire frame.
Procedure
Duplicating and renaming the hello-html directory
 Duplicate your hello-html Replit. The easiest way is to just copy and paste your code.
 If you completed the Going Further, remove any inline styling attached to the semantic divs.
Creating the styles subdirectory and styles.css
 Inside of your Replit, create a new folder named styles.
 Inside of styles, create a new filed named styles.css
 styles.css is where all of your CSS will be written.
Linking styles.css to index.html
 Inside of index.html, you will need to link your stylesheet.
 In the href attribute for the link, you will need to route your link through the styles subfolder to reach styles.css.
Opening the wireframe
 Click the following link to open the wire frame: Figma Wire Frame.
 Note: This wireframe is not "pixel perfect" so don't stress having it match dimensions exactly. We are looking to capture the spirit of the wireframe.
Understanding the wireframe
 This wireframe has areas that correspond to the semantic divs you already have from Hello Html.
 <header> matches the HEADER TEXT areas.
 <nav> matches the LINK areas that contain four links.
 The white boxes with black diagonal lines should be placeholder images utilizing the <img> tag.
 <main> matches the MAIN TEXT areas. You will note that on the ABOUT PAGE, there are two MAIN TEXT areas with space between them. This is intentional.
Styling the divs
 You will need to utilize CSS selectors in order to style your divs. id and class are the most common utilized.
 You will also need to utilize CSS properties. As mentioned earlier, margin, padding, and display will be the most useful for achieving the layout.
Review
In this lab, we have translated a wireframe to a website utilizing CSS.

The software should:

Be a styled website whose design matches that presented in the wireframe.
Going Further
Customize the colors on the website.
Import fonts and utilize them.
Style your additional pages created in Hello HTML. Go back to that lab description for a refresher on how to create them if you did not. Try to have the visual design of these additional pages be coherent with the styling of the first two.
